This library provides an easy and convenient way to perform conversions between Maidenhead Grid Squares and latitudes and longitudes.<br>

## [VITERBI - Convolutional encoder and a Viterbi decoder written in Golang](https://github.com/8ff/viterbi)
This package implements a convolutional encoder and a Viterbi decoder. It can be used as a library or as a command line tool.
A Viterbi decoder corrects errors in digital communication by selecting the most likely message based on statistical analysis of the received signal and the probability of errors occurring in the transmission.<br>
