|[DICEWARE - Golang Diceware library and password generator](https://github.com/8ff/diceware) |
| Diceware is a technique for generating strong, memorable passwords using dice to select words from a list. The Diceware method is based on the idea that each word in the list corresponds to a unique combination of five dice rolls, making it difficult for attackers to guess the password. |
